          <p>
          FractintArt collections is a most innovative NFT Project. Arts are created in the a form of mathematical algorithmic by calculating fractal objects and representing the calculation results as still digital images.

          <h3>Why is FractintArt special?</h3>
          <p>
          These images have become more popular outside mathematics both for its aesthetic appeal and as an example of a complex structure arising from the application of simple rules. It is one of the best-known examples of mathematical visualisation, mathematical beauty, and motif.

          Images of the set exhibit an elaborate and infinitely complicated boundary that reveals progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications.

          <h3>What is the history behind this art?</h3>
          <p>
          Fractal art is a form of algorithmic art created by calculating fractal objects and representing the calculation results as still digital images, animations, and media. Fractal art developed from the mid-1980s onwards.[2] It is a genre of computer art and digital art which are part of new media art. The mathematical beauty of fractals lies at the intersection of generative art and computer art. They combine to produce a type of abstract art.
